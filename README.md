# WSL2 Kernel Build Script

Build a custom Microsoft WSL2 kernel from source, then generate a matching Windows `.wslconfig` file. The project is intended for Debian or Ubuntu environments running inside WSL2.

## What Changed

- The build script now uses strict bash settings, safer temp directory handling, and a local `.wslconfig` generator instead of executing a remote script.
- Kernel version discovery now uses `git ls-remote` against the upstream Microsoft repository, not brittle HTML parsing and not the GitHub API.
- The `.wslconfig` generator now validates inputs, detects Windows hardware from PowerShell, and writes current settings into the correct `[wsl2]` and `[experimental]` sections.
- A `config-wsl` file with full CAN bus support is bundled in the repo and is used automatically by `build-kernel.sh` (override with `--config <path>`).
- CI, linting, smoke tests, and basic repo hygiene files have been added.

## Requirements

- WSL2 on Windows with a Debian or Ubuntu distro
- `sudo` access inside the distro
- Internet access to download the upstream kernel source

The build script installs missing packages automatically with `apt-get`.

## Usage

Clone the repository and run the build:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/slyfox1186/wsl2-kernel-build-script.git
cd wsl2-kernel-build-script
sudo bash build-kernel.sh
```

Build a specific version:

```sh
sudo bash build-kernel.sh --version 6.6.87.2 --output-directory "$HOME/WSL2"
```

Build the latest kernel from a major series:

```sh
sudo bash build-kernel.sh --series 6 --skip-wslconfig
```

List upstream versions:

```sh
bash build-kernel.sh --list-versions
```

Generate only `.wslconfig`:

```sh
bash wslconfig-generator.sh --kernel /mnt/c/Users/you/WSL2/vmlinux
```

## Kernel configuration

The repo ships a `config-wsl` file with full Linux CAN bus support enabled (raw, BCM, GW, J1939, ISO-TP, vcan, vxcan, plus the common controller and USB drivers). When `build-kernel.sh` runs, it picks the kernel `.config` in this order:

1. `--config <path>` if you pass one explicitly.
2. The repo's `config-wsl` if it exists alongside `build-kernel.sh`.
3. Upstream `Microsoft/config-wsl` from the kernel source tarball.

`make olddefconfig` is then run inside the kernel tree, so any options new to the kernel version you build will be initialized to their defaults without prompting.

To use your own config, point at it:

```sh
sudo bash build-kernel.sh --config /path/to/my-config-wsl
```

To force the upstream Microsoft default instead of the bundled config, rename or delete `config-wsl` in the repo before running the script.

## Output

The kernel build produces `vmlinux` in your selected output directory. Store that file somewhere stable on Windows, for example:

```text
C:\Users\<your-user>\WSL2\vmlinux
```

Create `C:\Users\<your-user>\.wslconfig` and point `kernel=` at that file. A sample config lives at `.wslconfig.example`.

After updating the Windows config, apply the change from PowerShell or Command Prompt:

```powershell
wsl --shutdown
```

## GitHub Actions

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow to build the kernel in the cloud and publish it as a release. This is useful if you want to build the kernel without using your local resources.

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository.
2. Select the **Build WSL2 Kernel** workflow.
3. Click **Run workflow**.
4. Choose the kernel series (5 or 6).
5. Once the build is complete, the `vmlinux` file will be available for download in the **Releases** section.
